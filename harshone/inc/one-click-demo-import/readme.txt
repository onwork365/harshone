Harshone Demo Import Instructions

This theme integrates with the "One Click Demo Import" plugin to quickly set up your site with demo content.

Steps:

1.  **Install & Activate Required Plugins:** Ensure the "One Click Demo Import", "Elementor", "WooCommerce", and "Redux Framework" plugins are installed and activated. You can do this via the "Install Plugins" notice after theme activation.
2.  **Navigate to Import:** In your WordPress Admin Dashboard, go to **Appearance > Import Demo Data**.
3.  **Choose a Demo:** You will see a list of Harshone demos (e.g., "Harshone Demo 01", "Harshone Demo 02 - Fashion", etc.). Each demo comes with a preview image and a short description.
4.  **Confirm Import:** Click the "Import Demo Data" button next to your desired demo. Read the confirmation message carefully.
5.  **Start Import:** Click "Yes, Import!" to begin the process.
    *   **Important:** Importing demo content will overwrite your existing content, widgets, menus, and theme options. It is highly recommended to perform a demo import on a fresh WordPress installation or create a full site backup beforehand.
    *   The import process may take several minutes depending on your server speed and the size of the demo content. Please be patient and do not close your browser.
6.  **After Import:** Once the import is complete, your site's front page, blog page, main menus, and WooCommerce settings will be automatically configured according to the demo you selected.

Troubleshooting:

*   **Import fails or incomplete:** This could be due to low server resources (PHP memory limit, execution time). Contact your hosting provider to increase `upload_max_filesize`, `post_max_size`, `memory_limit`, and `max_execution_time`.
*   **Images are placeholders:** Demo images are often copyrighted and replaced with placeholders. You will need to upload your own images.

Enjoy setting up your Harshone theme!
